# Tinerii_de-a_lungul_timpului


I made this project in my senior year of high school, feeling inspired after reading the interactive article [This is 18](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/11/style/this-is-18.html?) on nytimes.com.
My firstÂ project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a fun and productive way to look back and see how technology had changed the lives of teenagers. It describes in a few words the decades from 1970 until 2019 and also presents some books, movies, and songs that defined each decade for teenagers.
